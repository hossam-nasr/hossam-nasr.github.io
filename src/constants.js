    "I have been passionate about Computer Science for as long as I can remember. As a child, I used to play a lot of videogames. At some point, when I was around nine, I decided I wanted to make my own game. I googled how to make video games, and was introduced to this thing calledn 'programming.' When I saw my first program saw 'Hello, World!', I instantly fell in love. Since then, I've been involving myself in Computer Science projects, learning about new concepts, and working with tech companies! In high school, I took multiple online CS courses, took A-level Computer Science and was an Teaching Assistant for both IGCSE Computer Science and IGCSE Information and Communication Technology. Continuing down the same passion path in college, I declared my concentration for Computer Science at Harvard and took multiple CS classes. Currently, I'm a Software Engineer with HSA Dev, the only group of Harvard students that run their own web and mobile app development company. I decided to create this website to showcase my CS experience!",
