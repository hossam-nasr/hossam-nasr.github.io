# Personal Website!

This is my personal website, acting as an online resume. This project was developed using [React](https://reactjs.org) and bootstrapped with  with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The website is hosted using GitHub Pages on [my personal account](https://hossammabed.com) and using the custom domain [hossammabed.com](https://hossammabed.com) purchased from [Domain.com](http://domain.com).

Due to the way GitHub Pages works, the compiled and built version of the website is hosted on the ```master``` branch of this repo. The original ```React``` source code is hosted on the ```react``` branch.
